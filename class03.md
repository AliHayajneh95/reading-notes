Here is a list of things a learnt in this reading: 

# Html book:

## Chapter 3: “Lists”
- [x] There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
- [x] Ordered lists use numbers.
- [x] Unordered lists use bullets.
- [x] Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- [x] Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Chapter 13: “Boxes”

- [x] You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- [x] You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
- [x] It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- [x] Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- [x] Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”
- [x] There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
here is the syntax for each

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    loop here
}

while (i < 3)
{
    loop here
}

do
{
    loop here
} while (i< 3)

if you notice that do while executes at least once
