> this is my notes from readings we do in **_201 course_** in my advance coding scholarship 

Here is a list of things a learnt in this reading:

- [x] How the web works:

    ## Browsers
    People access websites using software called a web browser.
    Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
    Chrome, and Opera.

    In order to view a web page, users might type a web address
    into their browser, follow a link from another site, or use a
    bookmark.

    ## Web Servers
    When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent
    across the Internet to a special computer known as a web
    server which hosts the website.

    Web servers are special computers that are constantly
    connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages
    out to people who request them.

    ## Devices
    including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile
    phones. It is important to remember that various devices
    have different screen sizes and some have faster connections

    ## Screen readers
    programs that read out the contents of a
    computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people
    with visual impairments

- [x] i also read some stuff about the structure of the book, unnescesary for someone reading
    this documentation.
  
  ## Structure
- [x] HTML pages are text documents.
- [x] HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround 
    special meaning.
- [x] Tags are often referred to as elements.
- [x] Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

  ## Extra Markup
- [x] DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using
- [x] You can add comments to your code.
- [x] The id and class attributes allow you to identify
    particular elements.
- [x] The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- [x] <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- [x] The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- [x] Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

    ## HTML5 Layout
- [x] The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to
    describe its structure.
- [x] The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- [x] Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are
    block-level elements.
- [x] To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is
    needed, which is available free from Google.

    ## Process and Design
- [x] It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is.
- [x] Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- [x] Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- [x] Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to 
    tell them.
- [x] You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
- [x] You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

also this more stuff i read form the other book about JS

- [x] A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- [x] Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- [x] Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer
    solve the task prggrammatically.
- [x] To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each 
    step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
- [x] Computers create models of the world using data.
- [x] The models use objects to represent physical things.
- [x] Programmers can write code to say when this event occurs run this
     code
- [x] to make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's
    model of the web page.
- [x] It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
    file.
- [x] The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file 
    (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
- [x] If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the 
    HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
