Here is a list of things a learnt in this reading: 

# Html book:

## Chapter 5: “Images”
- [x] The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
- [x] You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an
      image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
- [x] You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web
      page and in the appropriate format.
- [x] Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that
      use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

## Chapter 11: “Color”
- [x] Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the
      mood and evokes reactions.
- [x] There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values,
      hex codes, and color names.
- [x] Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- [x] It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any
      text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to
      read your content).
- [x] CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
      indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- [x] CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional
      opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Chapter 12: “Text”
- [x] There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight,
      style, and spacing.
- [x] There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
      most people will have installed.
- [x] If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
      several options, but you need to have the right license
      to use them.
- [x] You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters,
      and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or
      justified. It can also be indented.
- [x] You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when
      a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
