> this is my notes from readings we do in **_201 course_** in my advance coding scholarship 

Here is a list of things a learnt in this reading: 

# Html book:

## Chapter 4: “Links”
- [x] Links are created using the < a > element.
- [x] The < a > element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- [x] If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use
      relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- [x] You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- [x] You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## Chapter 15: “Layout”
- [x] < div > elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of
      a page.
- [x] Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or
      fixed positioning.
- [x] The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used
      to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- [x] Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- [x] Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- [x] Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the
      site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- [x] CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- [x] You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# Javascript book:

## Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects”
- [x] Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent
      a single task.
- [x] Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and
      may return a value.

## Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
1. Greater efficiency
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.

2. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

4. Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

5. Job interview readiness
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen.

6. Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
