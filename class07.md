> this is my notes from readings we do in **_201 course_** in my advance coding scholarship 

Here is a list of things a learnt in this reading: 

# Article
Domain Modeling

- [x] When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the
      same attributes and behaviors.
- [x] Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- [x] Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- [x] Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- [x] Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from
      outside.

- [x] Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from
inside.


# HTML Book

## Chapter 6: “Tables”:

- [x] The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
- [x] A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
      with the <tr> element.
- [x] Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td>
    element (or <th> if it is a header).
- [x] You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the
      rowspan and colspan attributes.
- [x] For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.



## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects”

- [x] Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- [x] Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- [x] An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- [x] In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of 
      the object.
- [x] Web browsers implement objects that represent boththe browser window and the document loaded into 
      the browser window.
- [x] JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their 
      properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- [x] Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
