Here is a list of things a learnt in this reading:

Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
What is the hardest thing about writing code?

There are many common answers to this question:

- [x] Learning a new technology
- [x] Naming things
- [x] Testing your code
- [x] Debugging
- [x] Fixing bugs
- [x] Making software maintainable

## Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain

What can you do about it?
If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

Make the problem domain easier
Get better at understanding the problem domain
You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

so its like video games where the first stage is a very simple tutorial and then
problems start getting more broadwide and complex

## Chapter 3: “Object Literals”
- [x] Objects group together a set of vaiables and functions to create
      a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.
- [x] IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS
- [x] IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
- [x] Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create
      objects
- [x] 

## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”
- [x] The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
- [x] DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
      element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
- [x] You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes,
      by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
- [x] Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always
      return a Nadel i st.
- [x] From an element node, you can access and update its content using
      properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM
      manipulation techniques.
- [x] An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements 
      that are siblings of each other.
- [x] In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is 
      a popular reason for using jQuery).
- [x] Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
