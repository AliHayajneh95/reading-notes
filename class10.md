##  Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”

- [x] If you understand execution contexts (which have two
      stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
- [x] Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
- [x] The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the 
      exact error.
- [x] JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you 
      its line number and gives a description of the error.
- [x] If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally 
      statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
